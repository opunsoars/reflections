How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it helped as the result is more focussed and the changes are highlighted.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    No worries of forgetting what was thought earlier. Collaboration easier.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros - you control when changes get saved. size can vary.
    cons - illogical savepoints might be generated. commit messages might not
    make sense

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A software project has code files that work together and are interconnected.
    Some changes in secondary files induced by primary file edits might not even
    be known to the user

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - to see the history of changes overview.
    git diff - to rrevisit and track literally save to save points.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Quite good and confident since it tracks every change that is made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    explore future projects and all possible ones. take risks with the changes i try. also upload 1-2 projects 
    or at least start new projects always from git.
